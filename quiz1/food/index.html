                    Rujak cingur is one of many versions of Indonesian rujak, a fruit salad which 
                    consists of different tropical fruits, usually served with a spicy and sweet 
                    dressing. Rujak cingur is a unique variety, because apart from fruits, it also 
                    incorporates vegetables and a rare ingredient – animal muzzle. <br><br>

                    Traditionally, beef or buffalo muzzle is used in rujak cingur, while fruits and 
                     are served boiled or raw. The dish is assembled and covered with generous amounts 
                     of spicy Indonesian dressing made with shrimp paste, peanuts, sugar, and chili. <br><br>

                    It is traditionally served on banana leaves and garnished with prawn crackers. 
                    Rice cakes, rice crackers, tofu, or tempeh are usually served as side dishes. 
                    Invented in East Java, this unusual dish can easily be found in the entire region, 
                    and it is especially popular in the region’s capital, Surabaya.

                    Rawon is an Indonesian beef soup. Originating from Surabaya, East Java, 
                    rawon utilizes the black keluak nut as the main seasoning, which gives a dark 
                    color and nutty flavor to the soup. <br><br>

                    The soup is composed of a ground mixture of garlic, shallots, keluak, ginger, 
                    candlenut, turmeric, red chili, and salt, and is sautéed with oil. The sautéed mixture 
                    is then poured into boiled beef stock with diced beef slices. Lemongrass, galangal, 
                    bay leaves, kaffir lime leaves, and sugar are then added as seasonings. The special dark 
                    or black color of rawon comes from the keluak as the main spice. The soup is usually 
                    garnished with green onion and fried shallot, and served with rice. Other toppings include 
                    bean sprouts, salted preserved egg, krupuk, and fried tolo beans (black-eyed pea). <br><br>

                    Rawon is one of the oldest historically identified dishes of ancient Java. It was 
                    mentioned as rarawwan in an ancient Javanese Taji inscription (901 CE) from the era 
                    of the Mataram Kingdom. <br><br>

                    There are several variants of rawon, with the most popular being rawon from Surabaya. 
                    A version called rawon setan ("devil's rawon") is sold as a late-night meal at Indonesian 
                    food stalls open from midnight to dawn, supposedly the hours during which devils roam.
